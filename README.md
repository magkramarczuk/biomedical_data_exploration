## General info
This repository contains project on "Biomedical data exploration"/"Glosowa lacznosc z komputerem" course. The main aim of this project was to acquire and analyze data with commands which can be used to build smart voice control system in house.
The project used manual analysis as well as automatic analysis using convolutional neural network.

#### Main content:
- PROJECT_CODE_FINAL.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook with code
- data - folder with commands' records and labels

#### Code (PROJECT_CODE_FINAL.ipynb) contains the following sections:
- Loading files
- Filtering
- Visualization of sample commands
- Conclusions on visualization - manual analysis
- Modeling of convolutional neural network
- Conclusions on model

## Technologies
- Anaconda3
- additional modules: librosa, keras, tensorflow

## Setup
